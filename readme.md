Build: 1.15.2-31.2.5 - Sun May 24 21:41:17 GMT 2020  
	cpw:  
		Improve the DistExecutor API and introduce some "almost completely" safe mechanisms to handle sided lambdas.  
		  
		In general, use sided lambdas safely by embedding them in a separately loaded class. There's a whole twitch stream  
		dedicated to investigating this problem. See link in DistExecutor if you're interested.
